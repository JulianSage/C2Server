## Purpose
A POST exploitaiton framework that provides resources for maintaining access to systems, connecting & sharing shell sessions with sibling servers (other machines running firaga) and other utilities.
 - Quickly generating reverse shell payloads for Windows and Linux machines,
 - Connecting & sharing reverse shell sessions with sibling servers (other machines running firaga),
 - Has a build in auto-obfuscate function to assist you in bypassing AV solutions (for Windows payloads),

An important part of this tool's functionality is inherited from [HoaxShell](https://github.com/t3l3machus/hoaxshell). One could say that, it is an evolved, steroids induced version of it.

## Approach
The reverse shell payloads generated by this tool abuse the http(s) protocol to establish a beacon-like reverse shell, based on the following concept:
