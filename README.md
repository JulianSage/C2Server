## Purpose
Villain is a backdoor generator and handler for Windows and Linux machines that supports multiple sessions. It also includes utilities that allow a user to connect with sibling servers (other machines running Villain) and share their backdoor shell sessions, handy for quickly connecting with others to work as a team. Additionally, Villain has a build in auto-obfuscate payload function to assist users in bypassing AV solutions (for Windows payloads).

The main idea behind the payloads generated by this tool is inherited from [HoaxShell](https://github.com/t3l3machus/hoaxshell). One could say that Villain is an evolved, steroids induced version of it.

:zap: **This is an early release currectly being tested.**

**Disclaimer**: Running the payloads generated by this tool against hosts that you do not have explicit permission to test is illegal. You are responsible for any trouble you may cause by using this tool.



## Important Notes
### Limitations
1. At the moment, Villain instances connected with each other (sibling servers) must be able to directly reach each other as well. I intend to add a network route mapping utility so that sibling servers can use one another as a proxy to achieve cross network communication between them.
2. 



## Contributions
Pull requests are generally welcome. But please, keep in mind: I am constantly working on new offsec tools as well as maintaining several existing ones. I rarely accept pull requests because I either have a specific vision for the course of a project or I evaluate that it would be hard to test and/or maintain the foreign code. It doesn't have to do with how good or bad is an idea, it's just too much work and also, I am kind of developing all these tools to learn myself.

There are parts of this project that were removed before publishing because I considered them to be buggy or hard to maintain (at this early stage).
If you have an idea for an addition that comes with a significant chunk of code, I suggest you first contact me to discuss if there's something similar already in the making, before making a PR.
